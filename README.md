# SI100B Introduction to InformationScience and Technology

SI100B is the introductory course for computer science freshmen. The course is divided into three main parts: Python Programming, Signal Processing and Electronic Engineering. Students have to finish the homeworks in all parts and choose one topic as their final project. My project is in python programming, and I worked together with Yiheng Yan and Wandi Peng. We built a web crawler to get the plane information and display it on a Raspery PI with a light.
